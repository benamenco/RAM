RAM RELEASE VERSIONS at http://cran.r-project.org/

Version 1.2.0 (released December 10, 2014)

      path.

      set. Only samples that present in both will be kept and 
      reordered to match all datasets.

      be used as inputs for comparison functions.

      otus and sequences at each given taxonomy ranks and visualize
      the output in a barplot.

    * OTU.revamp: returns a list to describe the percent of classifed
      otus and sequences at each given taxonomy ranks and visualize
      the output in a barplot.

    * get.rank: fixed a bug that keeping otus without identified 
      taxon name at a given rank; e.g. g__ or g__;

    * core.OTU: core.OTU in this version shows LCA of core OTUs. 

    * OTU.recap: now can handle multiple otu tables at one run and
      do a barplot to visualize the output.
  
    * combine.OTU: combine otus for the same sample. Suggested 
      to be use for bacterial 16S datasets. 

    * filter.META: Select METADATA Variables and remove the ones
      that only have one level, neither numeric nor factor and /
      or with missing data.

    * .valid.data: check whether ecology data sets have same

    * filter.Taxa: filter taxonomic abundance matrices by total 
      counts or maximum relative abundance.	

    * data.clust: plot hierarchical clusters of samples based on 
      ecology data set. 

    * META.clust: Plot Hierarchical Cluster Of samples based on 
      metadata

    * assist.NB: negative binomial test of seleted otuID or 
      taxon name.

    * envis.NB: plot the negative binomial model for selected 
      otuID or taxon name.

    * group.rich: Barplot of richness for a given metadata 
      variable.

    * group.spec: Boxplot of richness for a given metadata 
      variable.

    * OTU.ord: visualize cca/rda analysis on otus

    * Taxa.ord: visualize cca/rda analysis on taxa groups at a 
      given rank.

    * group.Taxa.box: boxplot of taxa distribution among groups.

    * group.Taxa.bar: barplot of taxa distribution among groups.

    * group.abunda.taxa: barplot of selected taxa in each group.

    * group.venn: venn diagrams for taxa shared by different 
      communities

    * shared.Taxa: summarize taxa shared by all samples

    * valid.taxonomy: check whether the format of the taxonomy 
      lineages in the otu tables are supported by RAM
 
    * reformat.taxonomy: reformat the taxonomy 
      lineages in the otu tables that supported by RAM

    * sample.map: plot the number of samples collected from 
      each location. For plotting distant sampling sites.

    * sample.site: alternative view of RAM functons sample.map and 
      sample.locations, suitable for plot closely located sampling 
      sites.

    * group.diversity: plot diversity indices among different 
      groups.
    
    * group.heatmap: add standardize and dis.method options

    * core.OTU.rank: changed the name of core.OTU in v1.1.0 
      to core.OTU.rank

    * group.abundance: can process more than 2 OTU tables now.

    * group.top.number: can process more than 2 OTU tables now.

    * group.top.percent: can process more than 2 OTU tables now.

    * group.indicators: can process more than 2 OTU tables now.

    * RAM.pal: generate customized color patterns.

    * The third public version.

Version 1.1.0 (released October 20, 2014)

    * tax.abund: fixed drop.unclassified option.

    * group.abundance: plot with adjusted and aligned x axis 
          labels. 
        
    * tax.split: previously used a function concate.split from 
          package splitstackshape, which is deprecated. Replaced 
          with new function in RAM \code{split.col}.  

    * group.indicators: RAM::tax.split.   

    * tax.abund: fixed the bug that fails to remove unclassified 
          taxon groups in defined blacklist when drop.unclassified 
          is set as TRUE. 

    * group.abundance: needs \code{tax.abund} when plot relative 
          abundance of top taxon groups at each ranks. Now it 
          correctly remove unclassified taxon groups when 
          drop.unclassified option is set TRUE.
      
    * tax.fill: failed to recognize unclassified taxon groups 
          in defined blacklist and replace them with the OTUs lowest 
          comman ancestor. 
      
    * OTU.diversity: calculates most used diversity indices for 
          each samples based on OTU tables.

    * core.OTU: summarizes most prevelant otus.

    * core.Taxa: summarizes most prevelant taxon groups.

    * group.OTU: plot function for the distribution of selected 
          otus.

    * filter.OTU: function to subset OTUs by either total 
          count or relative abundance.
     
    * OTU.recap: summarizes classified OTUs at each taxonomic 
          ranks.
     
    * .get.rank.name: internal function to generate the name 
          of a given taxonomic rank.
    
    * LCA.OTU: function to obtain LCA for each otu. Unclassified 
          taxa are removed and the lowest rank that an otu can be 
          assigned to is returned. 
      
    * correlation: plot function to display correlation coefficient 
          (or covariance) among taxa at a give rank and / or numeric 
          variables of metadata. 
            
    * col.splitup: function to split a column of a data frame 
          by predefined separator.
	

	* The second public version.
