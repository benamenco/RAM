  \subsection{BUG FIXES}{

    \itemize{

     \item Function \code{tax.split} previously used a function 
      \code{splitstackshape::concat.split}, which is deprecated. Replaced 
      with new function in RAM \code{split.col}.  

     \item Function \code{group.indicators} fix the bug caused by previous
      version of tax.split, which call function 
      \code{splitstackshape::concat.split}, which is not required any more.   

      \item Function \code{tax.abund} failed to remove unclassified 
      taxon groups in defined blacklist when drop.unclassified is
      set as TRUE. 

      \item Function \code{group.abundance} needs \code{tax.abund} when 
      plot relative abundance of top taxon groups at each ranks. Now it 
      correctly remove unclassified taxon groups when drop.unclassified 
      option is set TRUE.
      
      \item \code{tax.fill} failed to recognize unclassified 
      taxon groups in defined blacklist and replace them with the OTUs 
      lowest comman ancestor.

      of a given taxonomic rank.
    
      \item \code{LCA.OTU} function to obtain LCA for each otu. Unclassified 
      taxa are removed and the lowest rank that an otu can be assigned to is 
      returned.
